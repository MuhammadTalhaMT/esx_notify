I've redesigned the ESX notification system to give it a more modern and premium feel while maintaining performance. This redesign focuses on smooth animations, better visual hierarchy, and improved readability.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Modern gradient design

- âœ¨ Smooth animations for notifications and icons

- ðŸŽ¯ Distinct styles for success, error, and info notifications

- ðŸ“± Centered notifications with progress indicator

- ðŸ”„ Continuous icon animations

- âš¡ No blur effects for better performance
